Well well, *a lot have happened since the last entry.*

Mainly, I killed my ICLR submission by submitting a revised version with our names on it... A dumb
mistake that makes all my long nights of effort kind of ridiculous. My next target is the ICML 2026
conference. I wish I would have defended my paper up until the end. All those efforts have not been
for nothing, I will submit elsewhere.

I could see how my friends from the lab were sorry for me. I am grateful to have them at the lab,
this is important to have such good relationships during a PhD.

That exact same day of the desk reject, I got to teach and only 7 (out of 25) students were
presents. Most of them didn't pay much attention to the class. Not cool.

On the happy side, we got the keys of our new apartment! This is stressful to prepare everything for
the renovations, it is exciting to imagine what the end result will be.
