That was a productive week!! I rushed the writing of my paper and got a lot of progress. I almost
have a first version ready. I need to rephrase some parts and refine some others, but I have the
general overview of my story. And I like it as well! It feels good to properly explain our ideas and
methods. Could I say that I'm proud? I guess I'll be if it ever gets accepted somewhere.

I finished evaluating the baselines as well, which makes writing the story much easier. I'm not SotA
everywhere, but my results are strong enough to tell a good story. It's not a pleasant thing to
tweak someone else's code, especially when it's researcher's code I think. Ideally my code will be
easier to tweak.

Work has been almost the only thing I did this week. I kind of got addicted somehow to the writing
process, trying to improve how to share the ideas and how to organize the work as best as possible.
The blank paper is very hard at first but once the base is there it's a real pleasure to improve it.

Anyway, now is the time for my poster to be done. It should be done before Wednesday if I want it to
be printed on time before next week's poster session!
