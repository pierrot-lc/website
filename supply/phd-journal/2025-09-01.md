Today is the first [PAISS](https://paiss.inria.fr) day! And I got to present my poster!! This was
kinda exciting. I managed somehow to do a poster in two days last week and I got to present it in
front of people today. I got a few people interested and really trying to understand what I did. I
was surprised to see how little number of persons know about ALiBi and RoPE and attention in
general. I guess I overestimate how known those things are even in such places. I at least got one
student that find my idea really neat!

Other than that, I discovered right after finishing my poster that PENS-A is actually SotA on
TSP-10k when using scaling factors. I don't really know how I shoud present my results now. I also
read about [how to get your paper accepted][blogpost] which basically convinced me that my paper was
not ready at all. **I have about 20 days to correct that.**

Also, I hate the Inria administration. It's so hard to know how to do any single administrative
task. I got my train tickets and poster printed basically by chance.
