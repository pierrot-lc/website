This week I presented the latest trained models and I am actually happy with what I have now. My
supervisors and myself believe that it's possible to write a paper and so I started the process of
writing for the first time. I already got a paper in my previous company but I wasn't the first
author and I certainly did not lead the redaction.

This is actually very hard! Organizing the ideas, presenting the results, choosing an interesting
angle, selecting the right words... Phew! I remember I stumbled on a video from [Sasha
Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNlwVGxkG7Q) about how to write an *okay* paper. It immensly
helped me into seeing things. Combined with a look at the related work, I think I found the angle
with which I will present the ideas: **How simple Transformers can scale on the TSP?** or something
along those lines (*scale* is maybe the wrong word here because I'm just evaluating basic
transformers on the TSP).

I was quite stressed for a moment, I wasn't sure about the originality and robustness of my results.
Having an overview of the paper is relaxing and reassuring. I will also try to train a final ALiBi
model, either much bigger, either longer, to get a final model that should be competitive w.r.t.
previous works.

Other than that, I will be on holidays on next week. My friends are coming by. I'll be fun!
