This week I really started to implement my next research exploration, about the TSP being solved
with permutations. As always, it turns out it is harder than I originally expected. But as always,
**there is a paper [doing just that](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byt3oJ-0W)**. They cast the
permutation learning task as a reconstruction task of the input by applying the soft permutations
and a simple MSE. This is neat!

I love this feeling when I start a new project and I discover completely new methods that I could
use in many of my projects. It is also impressive that such a recent field can always back me up
when I want to explore a new way of solving my problems. I feel like I don't have to come up with
anything new but just combine the right ideas together.

On the teaching side, I did the introduction of deep learning with my livecoding session. Sadly I
don't think it big success. I managed to do the whole project from scratch (it was an image
classification task), but the students were struggling to follow my explanations and my code. I hope
they learnt a few things, and at least they now have a general idea of what a deep learning project
looks like.

I am not sure if I will do the same experiment next year!
