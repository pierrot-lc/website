I finally evaluated my final models on the CVRP problem. Even if my models are not very good
overall, they are mostly better than the others. Some even are surprisingly bad. I believe they all
have the same issues as my models: they face an unbreakable ceiling pretty quickly during training.
To me, this means that our approach is not a good one for such a problem, which is odd since this is
just a TSP variant, albeit a bit more complex.

I believe we should not evaluate all our TSP papers on CVRP. My guts tell me that our models are
just learning a very simple heuristic. Something that gives us mid results (from 3 to 8% of optimal
gap) on any problem size. The fact that performance does not seem to be impacted by the problem size
is a signal that our models are not really learning anything meaningful. At least, my models
behaviours were completely different than with the TSP. Further investigations should be necessary,
but I don't really want to dig. CVRP does not interest me very much.

This morning, we move to our new apartment and tomorrow we will go back to Toulouse. This is going
to be both exciting and stressful. I also didn't buy anything for christmas yet. This also means
that this blog will go offline for some time. We have so much work to do in the new apartment.

Have a good holidays!!
