title: PhD journal entry
date: "2025-06-13"

Today I start this new journal. My supervisor told me that it would be good for the thesis.

Today is also the day of the [CSI](https://webusers.i3s.unice.fr/edstic/4-5-csi-fr.php) annual
meeting. This is a moment where the PhD student shares everything he has done so far can talk about
both the technical aspect of the project as well as the student's health (mentally, physically, the
relationship with the supervisors, etc). The committee is composed of two external persons that are
here to make sure the thesis is going well and that everyone (both the student and the supervisors)
are in a good place.

I'd like to keep this journal up to date, it could be fun to have a read later on.
