Last ML classes this week. I start to realize that the most effective way to get my students
involved in my class is to provide practical exercises, otherwise most of them are sleeping. Sadly,
I think none of them are trying to code the solution by themselves. They all resort to ChatGPT. The
best students analyze its output afterward once they saw that it worked. I struggle to see how they
could one day become good programmers, yet I really don't know how I should approach this.

That's why next week I'm gonna show them that it is actually possible to code by yourself. To start
my DL class, I will implement in front of them a whole DL project. I hope that they won't get bored,
and that with my explanations it will be kind of easy to follow what I'm doing. We'll see!

My relationship with my supervisors is getting much better since the ICLR submission. And I believe
my next research direction is gonna be very interesting. I started the first lines of code, but no
model trained yet. I have big plans.
