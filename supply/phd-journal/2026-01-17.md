We moved into our apartment almost a month ago. It has been such an immense amount of work and
stress. I learned a lot of small things: electricity things, wall things, floor things. The only
things missing are painting things. There remain a lot of things to do, but at least our bedroom is
nearly done!

Workwise, I gave the oral exams to my students. Some of them were good but sadly a vast majority
couldn't tell me anything about the class. I heard that as long as at least one student learned
something and got interested this is enough. I'll stick to that. Two students in particular went
their way and told me that they really liked the class. It really touched me, maybe this is what
teachers are striving for?

I will resubmit my paper in two days to IJCAI. I am even more convinced by this new version than
with what I had previously submitted to ICLR. Let's hope for the best!
