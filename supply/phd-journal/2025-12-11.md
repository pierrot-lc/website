I keep running after the time. I am rushing everything and keep thinking about what I should do
next. With the new apartment, the thesis and the class, I have been multitasking so much that I
forgot to take some time for my close ones and myself. I remember reading about living the moment.

I kind of released the pressure since then. There will be delays. My next paper won't have the
greatest results. Class is almost finished. It's fine.

Now, I have to think about what presents I will offer for christmas, and that is going to be much
more fun.

A friend shared [the songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_bUOrEz7c) of a game we used to play
as a kid. I remember waiting for my little gaming session of 30 minutes everyday (_which summed up
to 1 hour thanks to my little brother_). The day after, we would talk about everything we did with
my friends, and everything we were going to do that evening after school.

This special feeling I have for this game, this feeling that profoundly takes whole heart when I
listen to those songs again, I don't think I will ever be able to live that again with another game.
Maybe it is something you can only feel as a kid, or maybe it is my memory of that game that is
tricking me. In the meantime, I can listen to those songs from time to time and enjoy those precious
memories.
