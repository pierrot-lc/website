It's been a long time since my previous entry! Since then I spent one week in the Azores and kept
writing my article. It's hard, and I'm still not sure about the story I want to tell. It's a little
bit complicated because we're not SotA on TSP-10k, but we are on TSPs under 10k. I still like my
results, because of the simplicity of our approach.

I also learnt that I have to come up with a poster to present for the 1st of September for the PAISS
summer school. So I'll have a lot of things to do for the next 15 days!! I'm a little bit stressed
but I also really want this to work out and to work a something new already.

We'll see next week how it goes ðŸ¤ž
